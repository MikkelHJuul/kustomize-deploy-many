# Variations on a 'k'
A docker image to handle deploying with `kubectl kustomize` building using environment-variables defined in a `.csv`-file 

This image is stil WIP.

THIS DOCUMENTATION IS NOT UP-TO-DATE, the API changed

## How it works
The script looks through your [kustomization](kustomization.io) resource tree and finds every base path in your kustomization tree given a

Then for each of these files it looks for a similarly named `.csv`-file, when it matches this it bakups the resource and rewrites this resource for each line of the `.csv`-file replacing along the way the using `envsubst`.

## What can it do?
```
variations-on-a-k {build|build-folder|kustomize|clean|deploy} [{folder_with_kustomization}] [--debug] [-- [some/variation.yamls ...]]
```
- `build`: a command to process `variation.y*ml`-files given in the command (every command except clean uses this command) 
- `build-folder`: "explode" your `kustomization` using `variation.y*ml`-files in the given `kustomization` tree
- `clean`: clean up /revert the `kustomization` resources that the other commands has changed
- `kustomize`: the `kustomize` command is a shorthand to run `kubect kustomize some/folder` after build-command.
- `deploy`: call the build-command into ` envsubst` then `kubectl apply -f -` (see notes concerning `DOLLAR`)
- Use the flag `--debug` to output debug info. (this removes the posibility to pipe `kustomize`-command) 

### `variation.yaml`
```yaml
apiVersion: variation.kustomize.configs.k8s.io/v1beta1  # doesn't matter at the moment
kind: ConfigVariation
variations:
- targetConfig: my-config.yaml  # relative path
  vary:
    csvSource: some.csv  # relative path
    literals:
      - JOHN: one
        INGRID: two
        MARIE: three
      - JOHN: five
        INGRID: six
        MARIE: seven
- targetConfig: my-other-config.yaml
  vary:
    literals:
      - something: FOO
        other: BAR
        else: BAZ
      - something: foo
        other: bar
```
## Notes
- the commands leaves the working directory broken!
it is meant for a pipeline, where the file-tree is scrapped anyway. Use `variations-on-a-k clean dir/` to revert constructed `.bak`-files.
- tip: use `DOLLAR='$'` for a value `MY_VAR` that persist all the way to the deployment: `${DOLLAR}{DOLLAR}{MY_VAR}` or substituted at "global" scope `${DOLLAR}{MY_VAR}` (for `variations-on-a-k deploy dir/`).
- remember to change deployment names and labels
- check what you can and can't do in `envsubst`
- I have no idea how this works with many deployments (I also have no idea how kubernetes or kubectl handles a very very long deployment config) I am usually only using it for a small amount sub 20 deployments
- there are probably a lot of bugs still
- there are probably many use cases where this is not working
- the csv-handling is very plain, and very hacky: see hacky solution from [terdon|stackoverflow](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/149661/handling-comma-in-string-values-in-a-csv-file#answer-149681) which is used to escape commas inside '"' and then replace `,` with `造` which is used as `IFS='造' list=($str_with_造_in_it_in_stead_of_commas)` (`造` is natively `shift-4` on danish keyboards).
- last but very important: escape `"` inside text with double backslash - `\\"` (e.g. in json `"\\"string\\":123"` replaces `$MY_VAR` with `"\"string\":123"` which is required for your kubernetes config to be parsed properly).


## TODO
- better debug messages
- implement a dry-run functionality (wrap clean method with `cat`)
